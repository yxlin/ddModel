Description: Provides functions for computing the density, distribution, and random generation of the Decision Diffusion model (DDM), a widely used cognitive model for analysing choice and response time data. The package allows model specification, including the ability to fix, constrain, or vary parameters across experimental conditions. While it does not include a built-in optimiser, it supports likelihood evaluation and can be integrated with external tools for parameter estimation. Functions for simulating synthetic datasets aer also provided. This package is intended for researchers modelling speeded decision-making in behavioural and cognitive experiments.
